Problem Statement for Main Round (2014-04-05)
Street View Routing

1. Introduction
The Street View imagery available in Google Maps is captured using specialized vehicles called
"Street Viewcars". These cars carry multiple cameras capturing pictures asthecar movesarounda
city.

Capturing the imagery of a city poses an optimization problem­ the fleet of cars is available for a
limited amount of time and we want to cover as much of the city streets as possible.
2. Task
Given a description of citystreetsandanumber of Street Viewcarsavailablefor aperiodof time, your
task is to schedule the movement of the cars to maximize the total length of city streets that were
traversed at least once.
3. Problem description
3.1. City
The city is represented by a graph, the nodes of which represent city junctions and are connected
with edges representing the streets. The graph is a realistic but idealized representation of acertain
city ­ the junctions are associated with concrete geographic locations.

Streets are modelled as straight segments connecting two junctions. Each street has three
properties:
● direction ­ each street can be either one, or bi­directional.
● length­ the distance in meters that a StreetViewcar covers while moving throughthestreet.
This distance contributes to teams score, it corresponds to the real length of the (possibly
curvy) street.
● cost (time) ­ the amount of time in seconds that a StreetView car takes to traverse the street.

Each pair of junctions is connected by at most one street. Each street connects two different
junctions. The graph is not necessarily be planar (due to bridges and tunnels).

Both junctions and streets are referred to using their 0­based indices corresponding to the order in
which they appear in the input file (see below).
3.2. Moving the cars
Your team manages a fleet of N cars, all located at the junction S at the beginning of the game.

The teams should schedule the cars movement for T seconds ­ this is the virtual time for the car
movement on the map, it is independent fromthe durationof thecompetition. Theteamshavethefull
duration of the competition to provide an itinerary that covers the movement of the cars for Tvirtual
seconds.

All car movement scheduled in the itinerary has to complete in Tseconds (or less) ­ acar cannot be
in transit when the time runs out.

The score of the teamis the total length of all streets that were traversed by at least one car of their
fleet at least once. Traversingastreet that wasalreadytraversedmultipletimes(includingtraversinga
bi­directional street in the opposite direction) does not increase the score.
4. Input data
The input data is provided as a plain text file containing exclusively ASCII characters with lines
terminated with UNIX­style line endings (single ‘\n’ character ending each line).

## Page 3

The file consists of:
● one line containing the following natural numbers separated by single spaces:
○ N denotes the number of junctions in the city
○ M denotes the number of streets in the city
○ T denotes the virtual time in seconds allowed for the car itineraries
○ C denotes the number of cars in the fleet
○ S denotes the junction at which all the cars are located initially
● N subsequent lines describing individual junctions. The i­th such line contains the                0 )( ≤i <N
following decimal numbers separated by a single space and describing the the i­thjunctionof
the city:
○ lati and longi denotethegeographical coordinates      − 0 0, 80 80)( 9 ≤lati ≤9  −1 ≤longi ≤1
of the junction in decimal degrees
● Msubsequent lines describing individual streets. The j­th such line contains the                0 )( ≤j <M
following natural numbers separated by single spaces and describing the j­th street of the city:
○ Aj and Bj denote the indices (0­based) of two junctions      0 , ) (A = )( ≤Aj Bj <N j / Bj
connected by the street.
○ Dj is either 1 or 2. If Dj equals 1, the j­th street is one­directional andcanbetraversed
onlyfromthejunctionAj towardsthejunctionBj. Otherwise(for Dj equal to2) thestreet
can be traversed in both directions.
○ Cj denotes the time cost of traversing the street: the time, in virtual seconds, a car
needs to traverse the street
○ Lj denotes the length, in meters, of the street. This is the score that is awarded for
traversing the street for the first time.

Example of input file
3 2 3000 2 0   // 3 junctions, 2 streets, 3000 seconds, 2 cars, starting at 0.
48.8582 2.2945 // Coordinates of the first junction.
50.0 3.09      // Coordinates of the second junction.
51.424242 3.02 // Coordinates of the third junction.
0 1 1 30 250   // Street from first junction to second junction.
1 2 2 45 200   // Street from second junction to third junction.

5. Submissions
5.1. File format
Team submission needs to be described in a plain­text ASCII file with either Unix­style or
Windows­style line endings.

The file needs to start with one line containing a single natural number Crepresenting the number of
cars in the teams fleet. Then itineraries for each car of the fleet should be described in the format
indicated below.

The itinerary for thei­thcar shouldstart withonelinecontainingasinglenatural number Vi            0  )( ≤i <C
denoting thenumber of junctionsvisitedbythecar. Thisshouldincludetheinitial junction1 0 )( ≤Vi ≤1 6
S as the first junction. Subsequently, the itinerary needs to contain Vi lines describing the junctions
visited by the car in the order that they were visited. Each lineshouldcontainasinglenatural number
denoting the index (0­based) of the junction.

Example of submission file
2        // Two cars in the fleet.
1        // First car stays at the initial junction:
0        // - the initial junction
3        // Second car visits 3 junctions:
0        // - the initial junction
1        // - the car moves from junction 0 to junction 1
2        // - the car moves from junction 1 to junction 2

5.2. Validation
For the solution to be accepted, it has to meet the following criteria:
● the format of the file has to match the description above,
● the number of cars in the fleet Chas to match the number of cars indicated in the problem
input,
● the first junction on each itinerary has to be the starting junction S indicated in the input file,
● for each consecutive pair of junctions on the itinerary, a street connectingthesejunctionshas
to exist in the input file,
○ if the street is one­directional, it has to be traversed in the correct direction,
● total time for each itinerary has to be lower or equal to T,
5.3. Scoring
The score of a solution is the total length of thestreetswhichhavebeenvisitedat least oncebyacar
in the fleet.

Each valid submission will be immediately scored and the score will be revealed to the team. The
teams are allowed to submit multiple solutions ­ thehighest scoringvalidsolutionfromeachteamwill
be used for team ranking.

Teams will be ranked according to their best submissionscore. Inanevent of atie(twoteamshaving
the same best submission score), the teamthat reached that score for the first time earlier will be
ranked higher. Resubmitting the same best solution again does not hurt the teams ranking.
